# Initial Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 Web Server Setup

Ansible playbook to setup web server and playbook to deploy laravel project with
zero time.

## Stedding Variables
Do not forget to adjust the vars in:

* `group_vars/all`
* `vars/main.yml`
* `inventory`

Not all will have to be adjusted perhaps but some will have to. This is besides the addition of the hosts file. Here you normally add at least the ip address for the server:
````
[web]
xxx.xxx.xx.xxx
````
The variables in `vars/main.yml` are for setting up PHP, MySQL and Nginx details based on Geerlingguy roles. The variables in `group_vars/all` are for the repo, keys, branch, user, password and domain.

## What initial-setup.yml playbook does

- install python2 and aptitude
- upgrade all software
- create user with sudo rights (skipped)
- configure sshd: disables root login and password authentication, also allows
to login only user created on previous step

## What setup.yml playbook does

- install
  - git
  - ntp
  - vim
  - tmux
  - htop
  - curl
  - unzip
  - supervisor
- configure automatic security updates (do not reloads server, only installs updates)

- configure iptables and fail2ban
- create swap file
- setup ssl certificate with letsencrypt
- install node.js, npm and yarn
- install nginx
- install memcached
- install rabbitmq
- install php and composer

- creates following folders structure for zero time deployment:
  - `/path/to/domain`
    - `current` -> `/link/to/latest/release`
    - `persistent`
      - `storage`
    - `releases`
      - `2017-08-10-10-00-00`
      - `2017-08-11-10-00-00`
      - `2017-08-12-10-00-00`

## What deploy.yml playbook does

- clone repository
- set correct permissions
- link `/path/to/release/storage` to `/path/to/domain/persistent/storage`
- install composer dependencies
- link `/path/to/release/.env` to `/path/to/domain/persistent/.env`
- install npm dependencies and generate assets
- optimize laravel application
- backup database
- run new migrations
- link `/path/to/domain/current` to `/path/to/domain/releases/new-release`
- delete all, but 10 latest releases

If build fails

- rollback migrations
- remove new release folder
- link `/path/to/domain/current` to `/path/to/domain/releases/last-success-release`

## Install

### Inventory file

Create `inventory` file in project root. You should specify ip address of your
server in this file.

```
[web]
46.101.210.137
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

### Environment variables

Copy `vars/main.yml.example` to `vars/main.yml` and change variable values for
your needs. For security reasons you may want to encrypt this file using
ansible-vault:
```bash
ansible-vault encrypt vars/main.yml
```
And then edit this file
with
```bash
ansible-vault edit vars/main.yml
```

To see all available variables take a look at `roles/*/defaults/main.yml`. Also
visit external roles github page for additional documentation.

To generate password for your user use

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y whois
mkpasswd --method=SHA-512
```

### Nginx and php-fpm configs

- Site config for nginx place in `roles/nginx/templates/yoursite.j2`
- Php-fpm pool config place in `roles/php/templates/yoursite.conf.j2`
- Default configs are available in this
[gist](https://gist.github.com/melihovv/ff11a76ee8b4fba28ecb4b681cb91818)

### Initial setup

By default on ubuntu 16.04 there is no python 2 and aptitude. Without those
programs ansible cannot work. To fix it run:

```bash
ansible-playbook initial-setup.yml
```

Beside it this playbook also creates user and configures ssh server.

### Provision server

This playbook setup nginx, php-fpm, mysql, nodejs, etc.

```bash
ansible-playbook setup.yml
```

### To run only specific roles

```bash
ansible-playbook setup.yml --tags=user,nginx
```

### To exclude specific roles

```bash
ansible-playbook setup.yml --skip-tags=user,nginx
```

### Deploy

```bash
ansible-playbook deploy.yml
```
